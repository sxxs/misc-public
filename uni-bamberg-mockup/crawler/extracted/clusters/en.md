# Anti-Discrimination at the University of Bamberg

The University of Bamberg advocates a collaborative working and study environment, as this creates cooperation between all university members that is both contented and conducive to good health.

For this reason, there is no place at the university for harassment, discrimination, bullying and stalking based on age, disability, ethnic origin, religion/ideology, gender, or sexual identity. This is also anchored in the university’s“Respecting Boundaries” guidelines(Richtlinie “Grenzen wahren”) which were updated in April 2024 and serve as the current guideline of the Anti-Discrimination Office of the University of Bamberg.

## What is Discrimination

The university’s “Respecting Boundaries” guidelines define discrimination as follows:

“Discrimination demeans a person’s dignity and restricts his or her rights and freedoms. This comprises any unjustified disadvantage to a person based on a factor that the person concerned cannot influence by his or her own action."

The termdiscriminationdescribes treatment that disadvantages a person on the grounds of a protected characteristic such as gender, age, ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation or religion.

Such a disadvantage always occurs whensomething equal is treated unequally. It is important that theresultis decisive, not the motive. As such, it is irrelevant whether or not a person’s action was intentional. The prohibition of discrimination is anchored in the German Constitution (Deutsches Grundgesetz, Artikel 3) as well as in the General Act on Equal Treatment.

Discrimination can be divided into direct and indirect discrimination.Direct discriminationdescribes that one person is treated less favorably than another in a comparable situation based on the grounds of the above-mentioned characteristics.Indirect discriminationoccurs on the grounds of a seemingly neutral criterion applying to all persons in the same way, but that in practice disadvantages certain groups.

Further,harassmentincludes behaviors that – on the ground of the above-listed characteristics – violate a person’s dignity and are degrading or offensive. Thus, harassment is also a form of discrimination.

## Anti-Discrimination Office of the University of Bamberg

The services of the university’s Anti-Discrimination Office are available to everyone – students and academic as well as non-academic staff. In particular, the office deals with issues of discrimination, exclusion and harassment based on protected characteristics, such as:

- Age
- Disability and chronic illness
- Parenthood and caretaking responsibilities
- Ethnic origin or racist attributions
- Gender and gender identity
- Religion and ideology
- Sexual orientation
- Social origin and
- Attributions based on skin colour or appearance

The office’s contact person is Cindy Stroemel-Scheder. The office is barrier-free and located on the Erba Campus (WE5/03.083). Feel free to contact the office via email or phone (0951 863 1531). Detailed information as regards the Anti-Discrimination Office can be foundhere.

## Family-friendly University

We are one of the few German universities committed to tackling the issues facing parents and families in academia. For this reason, we submitted our institution to the Beruf & Familie GmbH (an initiative of the non-profit Hertie Foundation) for review.

We take great pride in the group’s findings: as one of only nine universities, the Hertie Foundation's review council awarded the University of Bamberg the "Family-friendly University" certificate in June of 2006. We were recertified in June of 2009, and again in March of 2012.

## Political Science, especially Digital Transformation
[Bild: ]
How do digital media impact the public arena?

Important topics are discussed and negotiated in thepublic arena. Digital media create new structures hosting the public arena while weakening others, such as traditional mass media. At the same time, they change information flows, the form and tone of discussion, and influence the success of selected actors. We outline and explain this new digital public arena.

Digital Transformations of the Public Arena(Cambridge University Press, 2022)

How do digital media change politics?

Digital media are an integral part ofpoliticsandpolitical communication. Politics and civil society use digital media for information, discussion, and mobilization. Digital media are changing the way politics is made, people inform themselves, and participate in politics. Our research contributes to a better understanding and governance of these processes.

What are the opportunities and dangers of artificial intelligence for democracy and the public arena?

The successes ofartificial intelligence (AI)have increased interest in its economic, social, and political impact. However, this discussion is often dominated by unfocused fears. We investigate and explain the influence of AI on democracy and the public sphere in a pragmatic and empirically justified manner.

What is the potential of computational social science for research?

Computational Social Science(CSS)investigates human behavior and social systems using computer-aided methods. The close interdisciplinary cooperation between social sciences, computer science and natural sciences is characteristic of CSS.

We use CSS to gain insight into new phenomena triggered by digitization and to open new perspectives on classical research interests in social science.

Computational Social Science

At theChair of Political Science, especially Digital Transformationwe investigate the influence of digital media on society and politics.

We are interested in how societies deal with the digital transformation. This includes attempts to promote and manage digital change and identify risks at an early stage. At the same time, we also investigate adaptation processes triggered by digital change in society, organizations, and institutions.

In doing so, we concentrate on the following topics:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI);
- Computational Social Science (CSS);
- Digitally transformed public arena;
- Political communication.

The chair is part of interdisciplinary research and teaching programs at the University of Bamberg in the field ofcomputational social science.

For example, we cooperate closely with economics and computer science.

In our teaching, we train students to independently investigate and answer questions in these subject areas in contexts of scientific and practical relevance. This includes instructions for theory-driven empirical work, for example in the use of advanced computer-aided, data-intensive methods but also in the form of surveys, experiments, or text analysis.

You can attend our courses in the BA and MA courses of the institute for Political Science at the University of Bamberg. You will find our courses in the BachelorComputational Economics and Politics (CEP)and the Master of Arts in Political Science with a focus onComputational Social Sciences (CSS).

# Diversity at the University of Bamberg

## Diversity, Equity, Anti-Discrimination

The University of Bamberg's mission statementincludes an explicit commitment to embracing human diversity as a strength. The university advocates for universal equality of opportunity for people of different genders and sexual orientations, of different ages, physical and mental abilities, as well as from diverse cultural, geographical, and social backgrounds, and from all religions and ideologies. It supports sustainable family-friendly policies for employees and students, is committed to internationality and lifelong learning and dedicated to openness towards a variety of social groups, including displaced persons.

By establishing a newVice-Presidency for Diversity and International Affairsin October 2020, the University of Bamberg has institutionalized its diversity policy at the highest level of governance, emphasizing the advancement of equal rights for all as a crucial, long-term goal. Prioritizing this issue presents new opportunities for an intensified, university-wide dialogue – on diversity as an intersectional topic in research, teaching, and administration, on the connections between excellent scholarship and social responsibility, and on the need to create adequate organizational structures.

Diversity activities at the University of Bamberg focus oncontributing to research on the significance of human diversity, raising awareness of diversity as a unifying factor, providing support to all persons affected by unequal treatment, and taking joint responsibility for the creation of greater equality of opportunity. These activities encompass research and teaching, university life and strategic, policy-based decisions. They seek to contribute to a university that is open and welcoming to everyone, clearly opposes all forms of discrimination, and promotes diverse perspectives as a vital source of its academic rigor and institutional strength.

Responsibility for implementingcomprehensive equality lies with the entire University Executive Board. Numerous partners support the Board in this endeavor:

- TheAnti-Discrimination Office(for all university members, i.e. for students and all academic and non-academic employees)
- University of Bamberg Women’s RepresentativesandWomen’s Office(gender issues pertaining to students and academic employees)

# Diversity Topics in Teaching

At the University of Bamberg, all four faculties offer courses that explore questions of gender and age, individual abilities, origin, or religion. These seminars, lectures, and practical training courses on diversity-related topics are extremely varied, demonstrating the university’s commitment to a lively academic exchange across disciplines. Indeed, the consideration of human differences is precisely what often connects our disciplines.
[Bild: course catalog gender & diversity_winter 2025/26_University of Bamberg]
### Course Catalog Gender & Diversity

The Course Catalog Gender & Diversity presents all the German- and English-language courses that engage with gender- and diversity-related topics per semester –in one file(1.2 MB), ready to download, and easy to browse.

It invites all students and interested individuals to take advantage of the wide range of classes the University of Bamberg has to offer on gender and diversity issues.

# Diversity Mission Statement and Documents - Diversity

# Diversity Mission Statement and Documents

Bamberg University is committed to increasing the awareness and fostering the appreciation of human diversity – in its research, teaching, and campus life. To that end, it is devising a strategic paper that sets out the basic principles and goals of its diversity-related activities. It will also initiate a diversity round table to intensify the university-wide dialog on diversity-related issues.

Diversity plays a key role in all of Bamberg University’s strategic documents:

## University Prospects for Further Development

TheUniversity’s Developmental Perspective(240.2 KB, 9 pages)(2015| only available in German), adopted by the University Council, includes the following programmatic statement: "In order to do justice to the diverse talents and abilities of its teaching staff, administrative staff, and students,the university is fully committed to diversity, inclusion, and gender equity.[...] The increasing diversity of students’ backgrounds, identities, and individual conditions (e.g., migratory backgrounds, broader social stratification, sexual identity, different university entrance qualifications, professional qualifications, disabilities, etc.) must be taken into account to an ever-greater extent in the design of teaching, courses of study, advising, and counseling." (7-8)

## Equal Opportunity Policy

The University of Bamberg has adopted a jointEqual Opportunity Policy(413.0 KB, 15 pages)(2019| English translation of sections A and B) for its academic and academic support divisions, demonstrating that it understands equal opportunity as a cross-sectional task: the document focuses on people rather than formal or managerial concerns. The Equal Opportunity Policy is meant to initiate structural change so that gender does not lead to inequalities with regard to someone’s choice of studies, study conditions, professional development, or working conditions. It addresses all university members, especially supervisors with personnel responsibility.

The Equal Opportunity Policy aims at “[t]he advancement of diversity, for example in cultural and religious terms; with regard to sexual identity and self-determination; the integration of people who have directly experienced migration. [T]he inclusion of people with disabilities is expected of all institutions in society. […] With regard to equal opportunities for people with transsexual, intersexual, or non-binary gender identity, measures to raise awareness and inform the members of the university will take priority. […]The university’s medium- to long-term goal is to develop a more comprehensive approach to diversity […], one which goes beyond the primary focus on an equal opportunity policy."(4) [The university will also work towards]"more visibility for the issue of anti-discrimination. To this end, this issue should be embedded in an overall diversity strategy.As a contact point for different types of discrimination, there should be a place at the university that functions as an antidiscrimination help centre."(14)

## Respecting Boundaries

WithRespecting Boundaries(153.4 KB, 5 pages)(2017), the university has adopted a directive to prevent harassment, discrimination, bullying, and stalking. The preamble states:Harassment, especially sexual harassment, “discrimination, mobbing, and stalking, as well as boundary violations due to age, disability, skin color, national origin, religion, ideology, or sexual identity” have no place at the University of Bamberg. (2)

## 10-Year Report

The10-Year Report(8.3 MB, 77 pages)of Bamberg University (2020| only available in German) states: "The university as a living space, as a learning and working space for all - how can this be achieved? [...] It means that all those who 'inhabit' this living spaceunderstand diversity as a value that needs to be protected and promoted. Diversity is as indispensable for excellent research and teaching as it is for engaged ways of studying and working at the university. [...] In the past decade, the general awareness regarding the need for a diverse and sustainable university culture has grown rapidly." (95)

## Quality Goals for Teaching

TheRecommendation on Quality Goals in Courses of Studyand Teaching(1.0 MB, 2 pages)(2016| only available in German) lists"Promoting Diversity" among the first of Bamberg University’s strategic goals,and names several more specific aims with regard to its teaching philosophy: Ensuring equal opportunity among students and teachers; ensuring equal opportunity for students and teachers in special circumstances; enabling (further) educational opportunities in a needs-oriented manner and for a wide variety of educational careers.

# Protection against Sexual Harassment and Violence

# Contact point regarding questions for the protection against sexual harassment and violence

The University of Bamberg advocates acollaborative working and study environment.

For this reason, there is no place at the university for sexualized discrimination, harassment and violence, since it is our duty toprotect all members of the university against sexualized harassment.

This is also anchored in the university’s “Respecting Boundaries” guidelines (Richtlinie “Grenzen wahren”(140.9 KB)), which serves as a guideline for respectful cooperation.

## What are sexualized discrimination, harassment and violence?

Sexualized discrimination and violence areforms of gender discrimination, violations of the principle of equal treatmentandattacks on the dignity and personal rights of those affected.

Sexual harassment isunwelcomed, sexually motivated behaviorthat violates the victim’s dignity and creates an environment characterized by intimidation, hostility, humiliation, degradation or insults.

Sexualized violence refers to all acts thatviolate a person's right to sexual self-determination.

Sexualized harassment and violence are particularly – but not exclusively – expressed in the following actions:

- degrading sexualizedcommentsabout people or their bodies
- exhibition or display of degrading, sexualized, pornographicdepictions
- sexually derogatorygestures, solicitation or acts
- inappropriate and/or unwantedphysical contact
- exhibitionism
- violent physicalassaults

If you feel that your boundaries have been violated or that someone has acted in a way that caused you harm, then your feeling is correct. You don't have to justify yourself. You are never to blame for abusive behavior.

If you have experienced sexualized discrimination, harassment or violence, we encourage you to take the following steps:

- Contact someone you trust and talk to them about what you have experienced.
- If possible, clearly show the person harassing you your boundaries and make it clear that you will not tolerate the harassing behavior.
- Document the incidents. Back up emails, documents, chat histories, etc. in a secure place.
- Take a consultation. At our university, trained contact persons are available to you. See the section below for more information.

If you are in a situation of acute threat, the following applies:

- Show your boundaries, but do not put yourself in danger.
- Keep your distance from the harassing person.
- Ask bystanders to help you.
- Call the police (110) immediately if you feel the situation is escalating.

At the University of Bamberg, various trained contact persons are available to you when seeking confidential advice.

Cindy Stroemel-Scheder(they/them)Contact Person for Anti-DiscriminationContact Person for questions regarding the protection against sexual harassment and violenceMail:sbg(at)uni-bamberg.de
Equal Opportunity OfficersResponsibly for the university's academic support staffDr. Katharina Kanitz(she/her)& Romy Schatzschneider(she/her)Web:https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/representative-officers/equal-opportunity-officer/Mail:gleichstellungsbeauftragte(at)uni-bamberg.de

All inquiries are treated with strict confidentiality.

In a consultation, the situation is assessed and together it is discussed what further steps are possible. You are welcome to be accompanied by a person you trust. You alone decide which further measures should follow.

All information shared with contact persons for sexualized harassment and violence is subject to data protection regulations.

No information will be shared with other university departments. If other university bodies are to be involved in a consultation or a complaint, this will only occur with the written consent of the person concerned.

If requested, those affected can be supported in subsequent mediation and conciliation talks and accompanied in complaint procedures.

Dealing sensitively with sexualized harassment and violence is a sign of leadership quality. Sexualized harassment must not be tolerated, trivialized or ignored by superiors. If you notice that boundaries are violated or if employees ask for your help, you must take action. If you are not sure what to do in such a situation, contact the above named contact persons.

- Keep calm. Be empathetic and listen.
- Always take reports of violated boundaries, sexualized harassment and sexualized violence seriously.
- Treat all conversations confidential.
- Do not ask for justifications.
- Encourage the person concerned to seek a consultation and support from a professionally trained contact person of the university.
- Do not initiate any further steps without the consent of the person concerned. They alone decide what further steps to take.
- If necessary, take measures to protect the person concerned.
- Take a clear stand against any form of transgressions. Make it clear that sexualized harassment and violence will not be tolerated in your work environment.
- Support the promotion of respectful interaction with one another.

- Keep calm.
- Take every form of harassing behavior seriously.
- Offer your support without putting yourself at risk.
- Do not do anything without the consent of the person concerned.
- In a situation of acute threat, call the police immediately (110).

# International Diversity Guest Professorships

To strengthen and promote diverse, inclusive research in international scholarly exchange at the University of Bamberg, international guest professorships focusing on diversity-related research will be funded in 2026, financed by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts.

## Call for Proposals

As part of the program, international scholars are invited to Bamberg for adiversity-related research and teaching stay of one month. The program is meant to foster international research collaborations on diversity-related issues, and to increase the diversity of research and teaching at the University of Bamberg.

By emphasizing the significance of diversity in academic research, the University of Bamberg heeds the concepts of diversity as defined by internationally recognized research institutions.Subjects of diversity researchare the dimensions of diversity and their intersectionality, including age, social background, physical and mental abilities, migration history and nationality, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, religion and worldview (https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en) as well as interconnected aspects, including educational equity, sustainability, racism, antisemitism, social inequality, and promoting democracy.

Conceptually, the various facets of diversity in research are best described by theAlexander von Humboldt Foundationand theDFG / German Research Council:

- https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/explore/newsroom/dossier-diversity
- https://www.dfg.de/en/basics-topics/developments-within-the-research-system/diversity-dimensions

During their stay at the University of Bamberg, the international guest professor shouldcollaboratewith their Bamberg host on a diversity-related research project andpresentaspects of this research to members of the university (i.e. in the form of a guest lecture); they are highly welcome toparticipate actively in seminars or lectureson diversity-related issues; and they shouldmeet with junior faculty or PhD studentsto discuss questions of diversity-related research. The overall and most important goal is tofoster sustainable international research collaborationson questions of diversity. This entails possible future visits of Bamberg scholars, including junior scholars, to the international guest’s home university to facilitate diversity-related research synergies on all levels.

The guest professor will receive anhonorariumof € 3,000 (remuneration including travel expenses, accommodation, and all other expenses). The stay ought to take place within the calendar year 2026.

International scholars withphysical and mobility impairmentsare expressly invited to participate in the guest professorship program. In such cases, courses, lectures, and research collaborations can take place remotely.

## Application

# The University of Bamberg’s Diversity Strategy

## Open-Mindedness – Dialogue – Belonging

## Preamble

TheUniversity of Bamberg’s mission statementincludes an explicit commitment to embracing human diversity as a strength. The university advocates for universal equality for people of different genders and sexual orientations, people from diverse cultural, social and geographical backgrounds as well as all religions and ideologies, and for people of different ages and physical and mental abilities, including people with disabilities or chronic illnesses. This is in accordance with the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) adopted by the German Bundestag (2006), the recommendations of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; 2020, 2022), the German Rectors’ Conference (Hochschulrektorenkonferenz, HRK; 2009, 2023) and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2021) as well as with the HRK’s and German Academic Exchange Service’s (Deutscher Akademischer Auslandsdienst, DAAD) Code of Conduct (2009), and the DAAD’s Diversity Agenda (2022). The University of Bamberg is committed to internationality and lifelong learning, promotes sustainable family-friendly politics for employees and students, and supports displaced persons.

By establishing a newVice Presidency for “Diversity and International Affairs”in October 2020, the University of Bamberg has institutionalised its Diversity Strategy at the highest level of governance, emphasising the advancement of equal rights for all as a crucial, long-term goal. Prioritising this issue presents new opportunities for an intensified, university-wide dialogue on diversity as an intersectional topic in research, teaching, and administration, on the connections between excellent scholarship and social responsibility, and on the need to create adequate organisational structures.

Diversity and internationalityare closely interrelated; they both embody and depend on each other. A university promoting diversity also advances internationality – it is pivotal for international students, researchers and employees to realise that all are truly welcome. At the same time, internationality also advances diversity – at every level of human variety. International university members or those interested in international exchange who are affected by ostracism for various reasons do, after all, require special support.

On a conceptual level, the relationship between diversity andgender equalityas well asinclusionis also very strong. This is because the idea of diversity has emerged from these and other related social movements, combines their approaches, and promotes an intersectional view by raising awareness of the complexity of diversity dimensions. Pursuing a holistic approach, the University of Bamberg sees its commitment to diversity as an important contribution to sustainable development.

Diversity activities at the University of Bamberg focus oncontributing to research-based knowledge of the significance of human diversity and using this knowledge as a vital source for innovative strength, raising awareness of different perspectives as a unifying factor, and in this way contributing to a university where everyone feels they belong and are heard. This also means opposing existing forms of unequal treatment (based on gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities, age, cultural or social backgrounds, nationality, religion, ideology or racist ascriptions), providing support to all persons affected by these forms of discrimination, assuming joint social responsibility for diversity – and maintaining a dialogue in each case. These diversity activities encompass research and teaching, knowledge transfer and all of university life. They require strategic decisions, based on university policy, which facilitate concrete action.

The present diversity strategy is closely intertwined with the new equal opportunity concept (2024) and several other strategy papers – especially the research strategy (2024) and the international strategy (2023) – and closely coordinated with numerous administrative units and university offices. These include the Academic Equal Opportunity Officers, the Equal Opportunity Officers, the Office for Students with Disabilities, the Officer for Students with Disabilities or Chronic Disease, the Severely Disabled Employee Representatives, the Anti-Discrimination Office, the Contact Office for matters regarding protection against sexual harassment and violence, the Family-Friendly University project group, the Central Student Advisory Services and the Staff Council. This coordination emphasises the importance of diversity as a cross-cutting issue and as a concept that combines different concerns and seeks to use knowledge and cooperative endeavours to counteract division, disinformation and ostracism. In the years to come, our aim will be to further expand dialogue and information service offerings for all university members, to strengthen the commitment of all involved entities and interest groups via networking activities, and to institutionally embed the achievements that have been made so far – for the purpose of a university where our human diversity forms the basis for excellent research and teaching, equal opportunities and an atmosphere of openness, dialogue and belonging.

## I. University-wide Diversity

Equitable access to education and multiperspectivity in research and teaching foster academic excellence and societal changes in equal measure. The University of Bamberg is serious about its responsibility for the values associated with diversity, inclusion and protection against discrimination, and it understands these values as an overall guiding principle. This is one of the reasons why the university decided to establish a Vice Presidency for “Diversity and International Affairs” in 2020. Numerous measures have already been implemented across all university sectors. These range from a Gender Equality Plan and new recommendations for the use of gender-sensitive language to the continuation of the ongoing development of an accessible web presence and to equipping more and more lecture halls and seminar rooms with audio induction loop systems. In addition to these measures, the university has developed a dense network of recent and coordinated diversity initiatives. These include the creation of a diversity website, the launch of an annual diversity award, the introduction of a diversity day and a diversity roundtable, the establishment of an additional conflict counselling and advisory service as well as a Contact Office for matters regarding protection against sexual harassment and violence. The resulting increased visibility of diversity issues and heightened awareness for their importance across the entire university are to be maintained and further enhanced by pursuing already established activities, making tailored additions and enhancing synergies.

### Aims and Measures

A 1The percentage ofwomen holding a professorship(W2 or W3) shall, at the very least, not fall below the current level of 33 %, and should ideally exceed this level.

- MThe university will prepare a newequal opportunity concept, adopting holistic, intersectional measures aimed at further enforcing the changes in structure and awareness that have been initiated so far, and at emphasising processes to reach gender parity in professorships.
- MAccompanying measures to increase the proportion of professorships held by women shall include the financing ofacademic staff positions(E13 for a maximum of two years) as part of appointment negotiations with female professors.

A 2Female postdoctoral researchersshall be supported in their careers in order to counteract the leaky pipeline phenomenon.

- MFemale non-professorial academic staff members will be given the opportunity to apply for the funding of an appropriate number ofstudent assistant hoursfor current research projects within the newly established “Stay Tuned” funding programme.

A 3The proportion offemale non-professorial academic staff members in administrative committeesshall be increased across the entire university.

- MPostdoctoral researchers doing administrative committee work will be given the opportunity to apply for additionalstudent assistant hourswithin the framework of the “Stay Tuned” funding programme.

A 4Thepercentage of female committee and board members, which is usually significantly lower than 50 %, is to be increased, despite there being fewer female scholars than male scholars.

- MWomen who are experiencing disproportionate strain due to their membership in several committees and boards will have the opportunity to apply forfinancial relief supportby simple request.

A 5The university’saccessibilityshall be improved.

- MAdditional audio induction loop systemswill be installed within the limits of the financial resources available. For this purpose, the university will purchase headphone receivers which will be available for persons with concentration difficulties to borrow via the Office for Students with Disabilities.
- MAdjustableroom dividerswhich can be used during examinations and similar situations will be procured for persons with cognitive disabilities and persons with social phobia symptoms for use upon request.

A 6Disadvantage compensationfor all students, doctoral candidates and habilitation candidates with disabilities or chronic disease as well as for female students in the maternity protection period and students with children or who provide care for family members will be enshrined more deeply into existing university structures and communicated more clearly within and outside the university.

- MThe possibility of applying for disadvantage compensation will also be enshrined indoctoral and habilitation regulations.
- MInternationalexchange studentswith disabilities or chronic disease are given the possibility to submit their application for disadvantage compensations to the Officer for Students with Disabilities or Chronic Disease.
- MThe internalaccreditationprocess shall ensure that students’ degree programmes will properly inform them of the possibility to apply for disadvantage compensation.

A 7The proportion ofpersons with disabilitiesis to be increased in all areas of university life (students, research and teaching staff, academic support staff).

- MThe university’s attractiveness for persons with disabilities will be increased via improvements to relevantstructuresand intensification ofcommunicationon the subject of disabilities both within and outside the university.

A 8The liaison and coordination between thedifferent fields of diversity workshall be improved via e.g. intensified communication, direct collaboration and the definition of mutual goals.

- MOne personwill be assigned to develop, coordinate, implement and evaluate intersectional diversity measures. This shall help to preserve resources, utilise synergies and secure continuity and sustained expertise in this increasingly prominent field.

A 9Thestrategic exchangeon diversity-related topics and initiatives shall be intensified.

- MThe individual faculties will discuss potentialdiversity conceptsbased on development perspectives of the faculties, the university-wide diversity concept and a regular exchange between the university administration and faculty deans, the various Equal Opportunity Officers and other contact points (e.g. Anti-Discrimination Office).
- MAll faculties are encouraged to implement structures which have already been developed by single faculties, e.g.diversity officers(Social Sciences, Economics and Business Administration),faculty diversity round tables(Social Sciences, Economics and Business Administration),diversity networks and newsletters(Human Sciences and Education, Social Sciences, Economics and Business Administration).

A 10Thesensitisationof all university employees to the topics of diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion shall be continued, with the perspective that each employee will have completed an anti-bias training.

- MTraining and information events on various diversity topicswill be organised for all university members, especially persons in higher, advisory and training positions.
- MThe university will offer regular training and information events in order to reduce unconscious prejudices and will urge all university members to complete ananti-bias training.

A 11Adiversity monitoringwithin the framework of legal feasibility shall be initiated.

- MBased onvoluntary surveys, university members’ needs regarding inclusion and other diversity topics will be identified in order to develop suitable measures.

A 12Publicinformational and cultural eventsas well as other events with a symbolic character shall continue to be utilised to support content-related discussions on the topic of diversity.

# Research

## Combining Digitalization and Behavioral Economics

Networked products – from smart meters to cars to heating systems to step counters – make available ever-larger amounts of data. In our research, we

1. develop machine learning techniques that extract information from such data traces and provide insights into both the product states and the behavior of their users,
2. make use of the data to better understand how individuals act and respond to behavioral interventions in natural environments,
3. develop scalable behavioral interventions, e.g., to foster resource conservation and safer driving, and
4. help create digital services that make use of the nexus of digitalization and behavioral economics.

## Our Objectives

Our research goal is to advance the methods and theories in our area of work as well as to develop and validate information systems that deploy the results in the field. For private individuals, our research shall lead to information systems that help them to make better decisions in their every-day lives (e.g., systems that mitigate decision biases regarding energy use). For companies, the results help to develop tools to gain better customer insights, to create products that use behavioral data in a rewarding way, and ultimately to craft digital services around their tangible products.

## Impact

Recent projects have been named research highlight (e.g., by Nature Energy or the Swiss Federal Office of Energy), served as basis of decision-making for regulatory bodies (e.g., the Smart Meter Impact Assessment for Switzerland) or led to successful spinoff companies (BEN Energy AG and Amphiro AG).

With our work, we are an active member of the Information Systems (IS) and Energy Informatics community. Results have been published in the leading IS and energy journals incl. MIS Quarterly, Management Science, Applied Energy, Energy, Energy Policy, and Transportation Research. The >list of publications is available here.

# Equal Opportunity at the University of Bamberg

Equal opportunity is a cross-sectional issue at our University. While the law distinguishes between the gender equality mandate for academic and non-academic staff, we understand the promotion of gender equality as a topic that affects us all and that we therefore want to address collectively. In addition to target group-specific offerings and measures that are part of our gender equality work, we also handle thematically relevant points of intersection in collaboration with colleagues across the University.

## Guidelines & Agreements

The Institute for Archaeology, Heritage Conservation Studies and Art History (IADK) brings together eight fields of study concerned with material culture, historic monuments and works of art from prehistory to the present. Together they cover an extremely broad spectrum both chronologically and in terms of content and methodology, and thus offer ideal conditions for the development of interdisciplinary approaches to problems in cultural history and heritage conservation. The fields represented in the IADK explore topics in the humanities and cultural sciences through a focus on material artefacts, which are used to generate new insights into the lives and cultures of the past. At the same time, a prominent role is given to problem-oriented theoretical discourses in the artistic and cultural sciences.

A distinguishing feature of the Institute is the special emphasis placed on practice-oriented approaches in research and teaching. These are accompanied by a thorough grounding and training in academic theory and method. The marriage of theoretical knowledge with practical application stands at the centre of the Institute's commitment to interdisciplinary cooperation in both instruction and research. Hands-on work in various forms, including excursions, internships and exercises using original objects, is therefore an important element of the study programme in Bamberg.

The wide variety of activities undertaken by the fields represented in the IADK are also directed at stimulating transfer and exchange with external organizations and agencies. These include longstanding cooperative arrangements with museums and academic institutions in Germany and abroad, as well as regular participation in excavations, exhibitions and restoration projects.

The research efforts of students and scholars are supported by a pool of cutting-edge technical equipment, including a tachymeter, specialized microscopes and a complete dendrochronological laboratory.

# Master’s Degree Programme in European Economic Studies (EES)

## Understanding international correlations – interdisciplinary Economics studies

The globalisation of markets and economies requires an understanding of international economic structures, foreign cultures and foreign language skills. In the 2000/01 winter semester, "European Economic Studies (EES)" became Bavaria’s first consecutive bachelor’s/master’s programme in economics (and one of the first in Germany) that addresses precisely these topics and is based on a 3 + 2 model (3-year bachelor’s degree + 2-year master’s). In addition to a variety of electives, practical relevance and an internationally oriented curriculum, this programme places special emphasis on interdisciplinarity with regard to relevant subject matter from the social sciences and economics.

The primary prerequisite for successfully completing an economics degree is an interest in economic issues and related phenomena in broader society. Additionally, the ability to think analytically is particularly pertinent for comprehending and structuring complex interrelationships. Economics examines macroeconomic structures (economic and industrial policy, globalisation and financial markets, economics of education and labour markets, etc.). The theoretical approach to economics largely employs mathematical and statistical methods. However, this in no way means that only true 'maths buffs' can successfully complete this degree. Nevertheless, a willingness to explore and apply mathematical methods is required.

The master's programme focuses on the development of an individual academic profile. This is ensured, among other things, by a high degree of academic flexibility, and internationality and interdisciplinarity, with a distinct behavioural economics profile, are paramount. The programme curriculum is rounded out with training in one or two foreign business languages and numerous specialisation options. Possible elective fields include related disciplines like business administration, political science, sociology or law.

## Accreditation and system accreditation

The system accreditation of the University of Bamberg was successfully completed in June 2019 when the ACQUIN Accreditation Commission determined that all requirements had been met. Since then, the University of Bamberg has been responsible for quality assurance of its degree programmes.

The EES master's program was last accredited in 2019. For students, this means that the program, with its structures and content, meets the required quality criteria of the Accreditation Council.

# Sustainability Mission Statement of the University of Bamberg

## Mission and Vision Statement

The University of Bamberg aims to make a scientific and institutional contribution to societal transformation and ensure its own future viability through a concept of sustainable development. Its understanding of sustainability is rooted in an ethical framework and guiding principles that emphasize:

- Respect for human dignity and human rights
- Preservation of natural resources
- Inter- and intragenerational justice

Sustainability is not perceived as a one-time end state but as an ongoing process of “sustainable development.” This involves continuous exploration, learning, and designing activities across all areas of life, ensuring that decisions take the following four perspectives into account:

1.Ecological Sustainability: Decisions must not endanger the integrity of global ecosystems2.Social Justice: Policies must be fair within the present generation and ensure that future generations also have the resources for self-determined living conditions3.Economic Viability: Economic performance must remain stable, addressing issues of livelihood security, meeting needs, and fostering equitable prosperity on global, regional, and local scales4.Cultural Diversity and Critical Thinking: Policies must promote cultural diversity and support critical and creative thought

This sustainability mission is grounded in theUnited Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)and Article 2, Paragraph 7 of theBavarian Higher Education Innovation Act (BayHIG).
[Bild: Übersicht über die Sustainable Development Goals der Vereinten Nationen]
Achieving the 17 SDGs requires the creation of knowledge and systematic skill developments. The unique combination of humanities, cultural studies, social sciences, and information science subjects at the University of Bamberg provides a robust base for the necessary research and educational task. This interdisciplinary focus enables the university to set specific priorities that can be enhanced through national and international collaboration. The specific profile of the University of Bamberg is particularly visible in the sustainability strategy, in which interdisciplinary target perspectives are formulated and associated bundles of measures are concretized.Accordingly, the university has a prominent, universal role to fulfil in realizing these goals. The university is aware of this challenge and is actively involved in shaping the necessary processes of change at a local and global level.The sustainability mission emphasizes scientific research and the dissemination of theories and results in teaching and education. All university members, status groups, and committees are engaged in creating an environment for sustainable development that is widely accepted, actively supported, and thus effective in the long term.

## Key Measures for Goal Achievement at the University of Bamberg

Resarch

- Conducts systematic analyses of resources, systemic relationships, and behavioral mechanisms to generate knowledge for societal and technological change.
- Evaluates options, fosters societal dialogue, and provides both foundational insights and concrete examples for implementation.

Teaching

- As stated in the university’s teaching mission, teaching serves as a multiplier for sustainable thinking and action.
- Provides discipline-specific and interdisciplinary methods and equips students to apply, critically reflect on, develop, and disseminate these principles.
- Recognizes sustainability as a multidimensional goal system that requires careful balancing of conflicting objectives.

Administration and Campus Management

- Strives to set an example on the path to becoming a climate-neutral and sustainable institution.
- Encourages sustainable actions by its members through tools like transparency measures for resource consumption and incentive mechanisms.
- Pays particular attention to the sustainable use and operation of its (historical) building stock within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bamberg.

Knowledge Transfer and Societal Dialogue

- Fulfills its obligation under the BayHIG to promote social, ecological, and economic development through knowledge and technology transfer.
- Aims to make its publicly funded knowledge available to address societal challenges and foster mutual knowledge exchange.
- Transparently discloses progress in its own sustainability practices.

Governance

- Aligns all university activities with the concept of “sustainable development” as outlined in the UN Agenda 2030.
- Establishes an institutional framework to embed a “culture of sustainability” through participatory involvement of all status groups.
- Develops and implements organizational processes and allocates resources to achieve these goals.

Concrete action plans for all five areas are to be developed within a planning horizon up to 2030, with continuous monitoring of their implementation progress.

The sustainability mission statement was drawn up by theSteering Groupand adopted by the Executive Board of the University in November 2022.

### Development of a Sustainability Strategy

Building on the mission statement, the university is creating a sustainability strategy through open working groups. These groups focus on six areas: research, teaching, administration and campus management, transfer, student engagement, and governance. Each group defines goals, proposes measures, and identifies indicators to evaluate success.The Sustainability Strategy Working Group consolidates input from these areas and will draft a strategy for review and implementation beginning in summer 2024.If you wish to participate, please contactnachhaltigkeit(at)uni-bamberg.de.

# Preventing Racism and Antisemitism (PRA)

## Shaping a Cosmopolitan University of Bamberg

The University of Bamberg advocates for open-mindedness, tolerance, and an appreciation for human diversity. The university opposes racist, antisemitic, and anti-democratic hostility and works toward a respectful, open-minded environment for teaching, studying, research, work, and university life. As stated in itsDiversity Strategy, the university is committed to fighting existing types of discrimination, supporting those affected by discrimination, and shouldering its societal responsibility for fostering diversity.

## Raising Awareness against Racism and Antisemitism

In order to achieve those goals, the university is enhancing its preventative initiatives against racism and antisemitism. Training courses, workshops, roundtables, and other events are planned to raise all university members' awareness against everyday, institutional, and systemic racism and antisemitism. With a critical eye toward its function and workings as an educational and research institution, the University of Bamberg strives for a safe environment, free from discrimination, that facilitates fruitful academic exchange and compassionate cooperation.

TheSTIBET-Program of the German Academic Exchange Service - Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)is supporting the university's work against racism and antisemitism. A concept for sustainable preventative measures, also in view of the university's international welcoming culture, is being developed.

## Working Definitions

With reference to theAmadeu Antonio Foundation, our understanding ofracismis that of an ideology devaluating people due to their appearance, their name, and their (assumed) culture, origin, or religion. Racism means judging and devaluing people because they supposedly belong to some homogeneous group instead of forming an opinion based on their individual merits, abilities, and qualities. In our societal realities, racism can take on many different forms, which is why we also speak ofracisms in the plural. Anti-Black racism, anti-Muslim racism, anti-Slavic racism, anti-Asian racism, and racism against Roma and Sinti are examples of specific forms of racism (cf.the 2023 report of the National Monitoring of Discrimination and Racism(3.2 MB)).

Our understanding ofantisemitismis predicated on the working definition of theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)from 2016:"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."

There are different forms ofdiscrimination- direct and indirect. As outlined in the university's directive "Respecting Boundaries," direct or open discrimination occurs when a person is treated less favorably on the grounds of one or several protected characteristics compared to another person in a similar situation. Indirect discrimination occurs when seemingly neutral rules and regulations put a person at a disadvantage on the grounds of one or several protected characteristics.

## Latest News

### Talk Times on "Respecting Boundaries"

The upcoming Talk Times event will center aroundthe university's “Guidelines for the Prevention of Harassment, Discrimination, Bullying, Stalking and Violence - ‘Respecting Boundaries’ ".

To further intensify the dialog among these individuals and their work, the university has initiated a Round Table against Racism and Antisemitism. Coming together once a semester at the invitation of the Vice-President for Diversity and International Affairs, the round table provides a regular platform for exchanging ideas on current subject matters, questions, and approaches to creating a more tolerant, non-discriminatory university environment.

# Unboxing Discrimination

The campaign “Unboxing Discrimination” aims to address the complex issues of racism and antisemitism at the University of Bamberg. We want to encourage members of the university to share theirobservations about and experiences with racism and antisemitismat the university anonymously.

With the initiative, we want to raise awareness of discrimination as a multifaceted phenomenon. To that end, we are focusing onracism and antisemitismin the first half of 2025.

Anyone who has encountered or observed discriminatory behavior canshare their experiences anonymouslyand, thus, shed light on the issue.

#### Statement of University of Bamberg’s President Prof. Dr. Kai Fischbach on the campaign:

“At the University of Bamberg, we are committed to an open-minded, tolerant, and non-discriminatory environment for research, teaching, and work. Guidelines such as the university’s directiveRespecting Boundarieswith its clear rules provide the corresponding foundation. We need a culture that identifies and labels discrimination as such in order to oppose it effectively. With the campaignUnboxing Discrimination, we are therefore especially focusing on racist and antisemitic discrimination on our campus. The responses will shed light on such discriminatory experiences. They will facilitate a dialogue and learning opportunity for us as an institution.”
Campaign box in the branch library 3 (Feldkirchenstraße 21).
## How does the campaign work?

The boxes for the campaign were available in the entrance areas of all libraries as well as the International Office from 14 January 2025 until 01 June 2025.

If you had encountered racism or antisemitism at the University of Bamberg, you were able to write your experiences or observations on the available slips of paper and put them in the boxes.

Beyond the campaign, we want like to encourage you to report cases of racism and antisemitism and to seek counselling.

The campaign is currently finished.

## Further Information

By conducting the campaign “Unboxing Discrimination,” the University of Bamberg wants toaddress forms of racial and antisemitic discrimination, especially relating to incidents that have not been officially recorded.

The initiative makes no claims of being a representative survey. Rather, we want to provide the space for sharing experiences that would otherwise remain unknown. Identifying discrimination is a crucial step toward combating discrimination andraising awarenessthroughout our university.

As part of “Unboxing Discrimination,” we are first focusing on racism and antisemitism. Nevertheless, we want to stress that the University of Bamberg opposes all forms of discrimination. We encourage you to share experiences of discrimination even beyond the scope of this campaign and to seek out counseling. We have linked an overview of counseling services further down on this page.

The university’s directive “Respecting Boundaries(153.4 KB, 5 pages)” definesdiscriminationas “demeaning a person’s dignity and restricting their rights and freedoms. Discrimination entails any unjustified less favorable treatment of a person on the grounds of a factor that they themselves cannot control.”

The term discrimination describestreatment that disadvantages a person based on a protected characteristicsuch as gender, age, ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation, or religion.

Discrimination is always subjective, whether intentional or not. Theimpact on the affected personis crucial, not the motive.

Racismis the practice of devaluating people due to their appearance, their name, and their (assumed) culture, origin, or religion. Racism means judging and devaluing people because they supposedly belong to some homogeneous group instead of forming an opinion based on their individual merits, abilities, and qualities (cf. theAmadeu Antonio Foundation).

In our societal realities, racism can take on many different forms, which is why we also speak ofracismsin the plural. Anti-Black racism, anti-Muslim racism, anti-Slavic racism, anti-Asian racism, and racism against Roma and Sinti are examples of specific forms of racism (cf.the 2023 report of the National Monitoring of Discrimination and Racism(3.2 MB)).

TheInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)definesantisemitismas “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities" (2016).

If you want to talk about discrimination you have experienced and would like some counseling, please contact the university’sAnti-Discrimination Office. All inquiries are treated with strict confidentiality.

You can find an overview of further counseling and advisory services available at the universityhere.

Do you have questions about the campaign “Unboxing Discrimination”? Are you interested in additional information on the university’s efforts to prevent racism and antisemitism? Do you want to get involved? If so, please contact the team ofPreventing Racism and Antisemitism (PRA)atpra(at)uni-bamberg.de.

# Knowledge for All - Open Access Declaration

Adopted by the university management of the Otto-Friedrich-University on 26 September 2011

## What does Open Access mean?

Open Access means that scientific publications are publicly accessible on the Internet free of charge and can be used, copied, distributed and reproduced without restrictions, provided that authorship is correctly acknowledged.

## Position of the University of Bamberg

The University of Bamberg is committed to the principles of Open Access as described in the“Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities”. In accordance with its mission statement, it is part of its self-image to make the knowledge created at the university accessible to society and the scientific community in a comprehensive, sustainable and unrestricted manner.

In addition to this social and academic responsibility,open access publishing increases the visibility of research results and highlights the university's impressive performance. For this reason, the University of Bamberg supports publishing in Open Access journals, on the university's publication server and in the University of Bamberg Press.

The university management encourages the university's academicsto publish in open access journals and also to promote open access journals as reviewers and editors. The financing of publication fees for quality-checked open access journals is supported by a central open access fund.

The university management calls on the university's academicsto publish their publications and research results on the university's publication server as original work or as pre- or post-print. It encourages them not to grant exclusive exploitation rights for the electronic versions and thus to retain the right of disposal for their work. The Otto-Friedrich-University endeavours to make all publications produced at the university available on the publication server.

The university management asks all university membersto support the idea of Open Access and to contribute to the establishment of permanent and reliable structures for the promotion of Open Access at the University of Bamberg.

# Sustainability

# Ecologically Sustainable, Socially Equitable and Economical

## What does “sustainability” mean for the University of Bamberg?

Separating rubbish, switching off the lights when no one is in the room, and leaving the car at home more often – in private life, an awareness of resource-saving and environmentally compatible behaviour is gradually gaining ground. But what does sustainability mean for an institution such as the University of Bamberg?

Asteering groupmanaged by the Head of Administration, Human Resources and Finance discusses possible areas requiring action and examines measures. It is made up of members from various university groups and addresses not only the opportunities for organisational sustainability, most of which are subject to very strict legal regulations, but also sustainability as a topic of university research and of teaching and studying activities.

This website accompanies the process and describes the various activities.

### Goals and decision criteria

First, the steering group drew up a definition paper establishing the foundations of a shared understanding of sustainability. This is to serve as a basis for defining further goals and decision-making criteria for the university’s sustainable practices. Accordingly, measures must meet three requirements:

- They must be ecologically sustainable
- as well as socially equitable.
- They must not interfere with efficiency.

Based on this definition, a survey was carried out within the university to assess the understanding of sustainability in the context of key concepts. You can read the results here (german only).

### Fairtrade University

The University of Bamberg holds Fairtrade University status as awarded by Fairtrade Germany in recognition of the university’s commitment to promoting fair practices in global trade.

### Sustainability as part of the 2019-2022 objective agreement

The University of Bamberg is the only university in Bavaria to also set itself sustainability goals in the new objective agreement!

Key objectives, which the University of Bamberg is to achieve by 2022, were officially agreed upon on Monday, 8 July 2019. President Prof. Godehard Ruppert ThD PhD and the Bavarian Minister of Science and the Arts, Bernd Sibler, signed the objective agreement at a formal ceremony in Munich. In the coming years, the University of Bamberg will focus on strengthening its research profile and will promote it more intensively, expand its digital infrastructure, and implement sustainability projects.

# Environmental management in accordance with EMAS - Sustainability

Start nav-mobile End nav-mobile TYPO3SEARCH_begin
# Environmental management in accordance with EMAS

The University of Bamberg is committed to systematically recording its environmental impact and continuously improving its environmental performance. The 2019–2022 objectives agreement between the university and the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts therefore stipulates that an environmental management system be established by 2022:

In its “Conceptual Identity and Mission Statement”, the university pledges to assume social responsibility. This responsibility includes addressing the aspects of sustainability and environmental protection deliberately and specifically. In order to mainstream sustainability, it is necessary to implement sustainability in both organisational and cognitive structures. This commitment has to be anchored in sustainability-oriented development concepts, sustainability strategies, incentive structures, positions of responsibility and authority, and in self-commitments and objectives agreements by means of an appropriate management process. For this reason, participation and successful certification should be implemented in accordance with the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).

## What is EMAS?

EMAS is a voluntary instrument of the European Union to help organisations to continuously improve their environmental performance. All university areas (research, teaching, and administration) are included. You can find more information on theEMAS website.

## The EMAS cycle

After conducting an initial environmental review, the University of Bamberg is now continuously improving its environmental performance with the help of a management system. This includes the definition of the environmental mission statement and an environmental programme with self-determined goals and measures, as well as their concrete implementation and auditing for the annual EMAS environmental statement. This environmental statement and compliance with all environmental regulations is validated by an external environmental verifier.

## Project process

In the 2021 summer semester, the project was launched with a kick-off workshop involving various representatives from the University of Bamberg. If you have already established aspects of sustainability in your field of activity or working environment, we would be pleased to hear from you.

# Environmental Education.Bavaria

The University of Bamberg was awarded theEnvironmental Education.Bavariaquality seal in 2021. Since 2006, the quality seal has been awarded to non-profit institutions, self-employed persons, and networks that are particularly committed to providing education for sustainable development in Bavaria and actively helping to transform society. The university has an impact on society with projects such as UniGardening or UniBienen (UniBees). The teaching apiary of the Natural Sciences Didactics  unit provides students with technical and educational training in setting up and running a school apiary and inspires them with a lasting interest in beekeeping.

“We are delighted that our efforts in the area of sustainability have been recognised in this way and that we now bear the seal of quality for our activities in the sustainability steering group,” says Head of Administration Dr Dagmar Steuer-Flieser. “The university has a social responsibility when it comes to shaping educational processes that lead society and the economy towards a culture of sustainability.”

The university is now allowed to bear the Quality Seal Environmental Education.Bavaria for three years, after which it will undergo recertification. The quality seal is awarded and further developed by what is known as the core team. The core team includes the Bavarian Society for the Protection of Birds (Landesbund für Vogelschutz), the Nature Conservation Association (Bund Naturschutz) in Bavaria, the Bavarian Working Group for Nature and Environmental Education (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Natur- und Umweltbildung Bayern), the State Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry (StMELF)/Bavarian Forestry Administration and the State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection. The quality seal is sponsored by the State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection.

# Fairtrade University

Fairtrade represents a small facet in the complex of sustainability issues and a visible and concrete contribution to the topic of sustainability. When the University of Bamberg was awarded Fairtrade University status on 13 June 2018, this served as a foundation stone for opening up the topic of sustainability. In May 2021 and August 2022, the University of Bamberg was again recognised for its commitment to sustainability and may continue to bear the title Fairtrade University.

Dr Dagmar Steuer-Flieser, the Head of Administration, Human Resources and Finance at the University of Bamberg, says: “Awards like these not only affirm our efforts towards greater sustainability, but at the same time spur us on to continue and intensify our focus on sustainability issues and to implement further projects at the university. Our students in particular also make an important contribution to this with their own initiatives.”

In the Sustainability Steering Group’s Fairtrade working group, students and staff work together on the implementation of further actions. For example, they see to it that the University of Bamberg implements activities within the framework of the "Fairtrade University". They also plan their own projects on topics like fair wear, among others, and are also open to your own ideas. Every University of Bamberg student and staff member is welcome and can get involved. If you are interested, please contactnachhaltigkeitsbuero(at)uni-bamberg.de.

The Fairtrade Universities campaign is organised by Fairtrade Germany (TransFair e.V. – Association for the Promotion of Fair Trade in One World; Cologne). The initiator is a non-profit association that represents Fairtrade in Germany.

Since the 2014 summer semester, universities in Germany can be awarded the title “Fairtrade University” for their commitment to fair trade after having completed the corresponding application process. The purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness of fair trade on campus and to deliver on commitments to sustainability and fairness at the university by practically implementing activities and assuming social responsibility in this sphere.

# Sustainable Health

## For high performing and committed personnel

The University Health Management system (UGM) strives to achieve the sustainable goal of a healthy workforce that is highly efficient and committed to realising the university’s goals.

It was placed on a firm footing in 2014 with the establishment of an executive administrative unit under the direction of the Head of Administration and collaborates with the relevant organisational units, working groups and individuals. During its inception, fields of action were defined with the objective of

- improving the environment for “Health at Work” at our university
- focusing employees’ attention on their personal health and encouraging healthy lifestyles.

Depending on current needs, priorities are set and measures delivered. These include consultations, action days, various lecture series, the implementation of mental stress risk assessments, and the promotion of physical activity at the workplace.At present, these activities and provisions are primarily aimed at employees, but in the medium term established programmes are to be opened up to target the student body.

## Interdisciplinary and cross-faculty initiatives

Different subjects are focusing on aspects of sustainability in their respective disciplines. Some examples:

InAmerican Studies, the main research focus is on ecological sustainability discourses in US literature and culture.1) The DFG project “The Environmental Imagination of Mobility: Umwelt und Migration in amerikanischer Gegenwartsdichtung (Environment and Migration in Contemporary American Poetry)” shows how poetry perceives migration and other forms of mobility as a source of critical and sensitive environmental perspectives and an integral part of human environmental relations. In addition, Bamberg’s American Studies explores 2) crossover between the early environmental movement and the work of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, 3) the “American Eve” as a literary figure through whom an ideal relationship between humans, nature and technology is negotiated, and 4) a new eco-heroism in US environmental literature of the 21st century.

TheChair of Foundations in Educationalso focuses its research on sustainability in the field of education. There is research on global learning in various contexts—for example, in the context of international youth exchange travel or getting involved in child sponsorship. In addition, there are various projects to research and improve the quality of teaching and the educational professionalism of teachers in countries involved in development cooperation, such as an international master’s programme for students from various countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

## Further current projects and seminars

### Sustainability in sales and marketing

Civil society expects companies and organisations to treat people, flora, fauna and natural resources responsibly. Students who will be responsible for business management decisions and occupy management positions tomorrow need to be just as aware of their responsibility as of their possibilities for action so that companies can operate sustainably. In both research and teaching, business administration therefore focuses extensively on questions of environmental or sustainability management. Sales and marketing functions are close to the market, and as such they are particularly responsible for acting in a way that is as eco-friendly and socially acceptable as possible.

For more than 10 years, theChair of Sales and Marketinghas therefore offered courses which specifically address sustainability. The Sustainability in Sales and Marketing lecture (formerly: Ecological and Ethical Issues in Marketing) has been offered every winter semester since 2010, currently under the direction of Peter van Dyck and Professor Frank Wimmer (lecturer, former chair). In previous semesters, seminars were also held on environmental aspects of business administration. A seminar on sustainable product management was regularly organised in cooperation with Siemens Healthineers, allowing many students to expand on their interest in sustainability management issues. Today, several of the participants have positions where their responsibilities lie in exactly these areas.

### Sustainability in value creation systems as a teaching topic

The Chair of Operations Management and Logistics is also committed to addressing the topic of sustainability within its courses and integrating it into the business administration studies provided.

This includes Dr Björn Asdecker’s decision—based on feedback from students—to redesign his master’s course “Supply Chain Management”. Sustainability is not only to be treated as a marginal aspect, but has instead become the central focus. This also involves incorporating real-world viewpoints and perspectives into teaching.

## Project Goals

The goals of UniGardening include:

- Fostering appreciation for regional food production
- Promoting ecological gardening in urban areas
- Engaging university members in gardening with ecological principles
- Shifting the perception of the university from merely a teaching and learning space to a creative, transformative environment
- Preserving the diversity of Bamberg's local varieties (the "green heritage")

## GreenCampus

On July 13, 2018, a group of students, staff, and members of the Edible City initiative upcycled two old carts into raised beds. In spring 2018, UniGardening started by building raised beds on the Markus campus. Since then, more beds have been created at various locations, focusing on food production and pollinator protection. In cooperation with the Bamberg Environmental Department, 650 plants were added to 12 raised beds as part of the "Blühinitiative Bamberg."

# Continuous Monitoring of Processes: the Sustainability Steering Group

## Who is involved in the sustainability steering group?

It all started with the desire to take a structured approach to addressing the topic of “sustainability” at the University of Bamberg. In autumn 2016, the University Executive Board set up a task force for this purpose, which has been acting as a steering group since autumn 2019.

From the University Executive Board’s remit:

“The University Executive Board has discussed the issue of sustainability and has decided to form a task force to handle its realisation in the areas of teaching, research, and infrastructure. It is especially tasked to ascertain what sustainability means for the University of Bamberg and to assess the situation in the above-mentioned areas. In addition, the task force is to identify concrete fields of action and questions and, if applicable, prospective certifications.”

## Open working groups with dynamic goals

In order to be as effective as possible and be able to work purposefully on different topics, the members of the steering group are divided into smaller working groups in which competencies and interests are concentrated on one topic/area. One to three members of the steering group are responsible for a working group. These are open to interested parties from all areas of the university. The working groups act independently, developing suggestions for improvement or for linking up opportunities in their areas.

The following teams are looking for reinforcements:

Infrastructure and Campus Management GroupCoordinator: Dr Dagmar-Steuer-FlieserMembers: Björn ChillaRemit: to gradually illuminate and analyse the administration’s sustainability issues and implement them according to defined objectives, e.g. to examine the introduction of a waste separation system or analyse and compare the optimisation potential of university buildings.

## Background

In the summer of 2020, a group of students explored the topic of sustainability at Otto Friedrich University Bamberg. Together with Dr. Yelva Larsen (Science Education), they developed a concept for a Green Office, which was subsequently presented to the university's Sustainability Steering Committee. With the support of this committee—particularly from Dr. Dagmar Steuer-Flieser, Chancellor of the University of Bamberg, and the university's then sustainability coordinator—the Sustainability Office was established based on this concept and officially opened on July 1, 2021.

The Student Parliament's Green Office Working Group won the Sustainability Award in the category of Studies and Teaching for their dedication during the founding phase of the Sustainability Office at the University of Bamberg.

# TAO - TechnologieAllianzOberfranken

## A Vision for the Future
Pressestelle der Universität Bamberg The four university presidents Jürgen Lehmann (Hof, 1.f.l.), Michael Pötzl (Coburg, 2.f.l.), Godehard Ruppert (Bamberg, 4.f.l.) and Rüdiger Bormann (Bayreuth, 5.f.l.) signed the cooperation agreement in the presence of the Minister of State for Science and Art Wolfgang Heubisch (center)
### Cooperation Instead of Competition

The TechnologieAllianzOberfranken (TAO) is a cooperation of the four Upper Franconian universities in research and teaching as well as with the regional economy. Namely these universities are the two universities of Bamberg and Bayreuth as well as the universities of applied sciences Coburg and Hof.

### Strengthening Upper Franconia as a Science Region

The goal of TAO is the further strengthening of Upper Franconia as a business and science region in Bavaria. Scientists should find optimal research conditions and students optimal conditions for their academic education.

### Research Topics

The core areas of research within TAO areenergyandmobility, as well as cross-sectional technologies ofmaterials,information technology,sensor technologyandhumans and technology.

Cross-location research projectsas well ascooperative doctoratesare listed on the central websites of TechnologieAllianzOberfranken.

## The University of Bamberg at TAO

Information Technology and Ethically Responsible ActionThe University of Bamberg shapes the alliance primarily with itsFaculty Information Systems and Applied Computer Sciences (WIAI)in the area of IT/sensor technology. In addition, the following chairs and professorships at the WIAI were financed from TAO funds in order to support the two major TAO focus topics of energy and mobility:

- Chair of Mobile Systems
- Information Systems and Energy Efficient Systems
- Professorship of Smart Environments

With theChair for Political Science, especially Digital Transformation, the University of Bamberg complements the technological disciplines of TAO with research on technology consequences and technology acceptance and thus with an ethical and ecological-social self-reflection and perspective. In addition, theChair of Digital Technologies in Heritage Conservation, which focuses on the integration and adaptation of digital technologies in heritage preservation, is part of the current five TAO chairs at the University of Bamberg.

## TAO Professorships and Chairs at the University of Bamberg

- Chair of Mobile Systems
- Information Systems and Energy Efficient Systems
- Smart Environments
- Chair for Political Science, especially Digital Transformation
- Digital Technologies in Heritage Conservation

## Chair of Mobile Systems

Prof. Dr. Daniela Nicklas

The MOBI group is led by Prof. Dr. Daniela Nicklas and focuses on Data Management for Mobile Systems, Data Stream Management/ Complex Event Processing and Development Support for sensor-based Applications, in the area of Smart Cities. It was founded in April 2014 within the Faculty of Information Systems and Applied Computer Sciences at the University of Bamberg.

## Information Systems and Energy Efficient Systems

Prof. Dr. Thorsten Staake

MissionDigitalization brings companies closer to their end customers, thereby moving the boundaries of corporate information systems to the homes, cars, and communication devices of private individuals. Our mission is to develop the methods and theories that help create value from the emerging data and use it to foster a sustainable development.

ResearchWe combine research on machine learning and behavioral economics to recognize patterns in data, learn about consumer behavior, help create rich customer interaction, conserve resources, and support individuals in their everyday lives.

TransferWith a clear focus on the practical impact of our work, our team closely collaborates with industry partners, federal agencies, and our spinoff companies. The nexus of methods, theory, and practical applications also constitutes an important cornerstone of our teaching activities.

## Smart Environments

Prof. Dr. Diederich Wolter

Smart environments is a young area of research in applied artificial intelligence (AI). The field draws its motivations from recent advancements in AI as well as in technology (disappearing computers, sensors) and human-centered computing. At the university of Bamberg, we contribute by tackling the following research questions:

- How can we achieve intelligent behavior of assistive technology?How can sensor data be interpreted to obtain useful knowledge?How can we reason with this knowledge in order to obtain smart decisions?
- How can we interact with autonomous and situated systems like smart environments or service robots?How can robust grounding of language be accomplished?How can assistive systems blend in with our daily life?

We contribute to basic research areas such asartificial intelligence,knowledge representation,qualitative spatial and temporal reasoningas well as technical and application-oriented research inservice robotics,human-robot interaction, andsmart environments.

## Chair for Political Science, especially Digital Transformation

Prof. Dr. Andreas Jungherr

At the Chair for Political Science, especially Digital Transformation we investigate the mutual influence of technology and society. We are interested in how societies deal with technological change. This includes attempts to promote and control technical change and to identify risks at an early stage. At the same time, we also investigate adaptation processes in society, organizations and institutions that are triggered by technical change.

Here, we focus on three topics:

- Digitalization;
- Artificial Intelligence;
- Energy transition.

In doing so, we primarily consider in our research:

- Population responses to technological change;
- Effect of information campaigns;
- political communication and campaigning;
- computational social science (CSS).

In our teaching, we train students to independently investigate and answer questions in these topic areas in contexts that are relevant to both science and practice. This includes instruction in theory-driven empirical work, for example, in the form of surveys, experiments, text analysis, and the use of advanced computer-based, data-intensive methods.

## Digital Technologies in Heritage Conservation

Prof. Dr. Mona Hess

The chair "Digital Technologies in Heritage Conservation" in thedepartment "Heritage Conservation Studies"in the"Institute for Archaeological Sciences, Monument Sciences and Art History" (IADK)at the Otto-Friedrich-University Bamberg represents the field of Digital Monument Technologies in research and teaching.

The newly introduced chair has the task of integrating and adapting digital technologies in the field of heritage management and its further development, as well as raising the profile of this research topic.

The chair holder Mona Hess is in charge of themaster's program in Digital Monument Technologies, which has been running since the winter semester 2017/18 and is conducted jointly with theCoburg University of Applied Sciences.
